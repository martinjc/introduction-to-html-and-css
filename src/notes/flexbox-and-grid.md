Now we're ready to move on from the relatively simple CSS layout methods we've looked at so far, and can look at Flexbox and Grid, two modern CSS layout methods that allow us to create complex, flexible layouts for our content.

Please note: there's a better way to fix the grid layout at the end of this video - rather than tell the `nav` and the `aside` that they need to be in the first row, we could set the `grid-auto-flow` of the parent container to be `row-dense` and that would make the browser fill the earlier gaps in the existing row rather than add a new row.

There are a set of code examples that accompany this course showing the use of the fundamental HTML tags and CSS styles/rules that we look at. (Right click and open in a new window/tab) if you're viewing this on Learning Central.
